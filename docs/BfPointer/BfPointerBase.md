# 'bf_pointer' Dialect

An out-of-tree MLIR dialect contained in the MLIR Brainfuck project to model the Brainfuck pointer.
The Brainfuck pointer is used to access the cells of the Brainfuck memory. In the context of the OptBf to ExplicitBf
lowering the latter is modelled as a <30000, i8> shaped memref. Since memrefs support access trough values of the index type, 
we model the Brainfuck pointer as a globally accessible value of type index. To enable global assessibilty we use MLIR symbols.

We declare the pointer symbol and provide read and write operations to turn the current value of the pointer into a SSA value that c
can be used by successive operations.

Example: 
    // declare the Brainfuck pointer
    bf_pointer.ptr @bf_ptr = 0 : (index) -> () 

    // read the current value of the Brainfuck pointer
    %2 = bf_pointer.read_ptr {name = @bf_ptr} : () -> (index)

    // write the same value back to the Brainfuck pointer
    bf_pointer.write_ptr %2 {name = @bf_ptr}: (index) -> ()
