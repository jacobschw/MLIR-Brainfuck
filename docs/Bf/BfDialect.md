# 'Bf' Dialect

An out-of-tree MLIR dialect for the Brainfuck language contained in the MLIR Brainfuck project .
This dialect is an implementation of the Brainfuck Language in MLIR.
See the following mapping of Brainfuck commands to Bf operations:

    Primitive commands map to operations without a region: 
        +           => Bf.increment
        -           => Bf.decrement
        .           => Bf.input
        ,           => Bf.output
        >           => Bf.shift_right
        <           => Bf.shift_left

    Composed commands map to operations with a region:
        [ .. ]      => Bf.loop
        ( .. , bf)  => Bf.module

Implicitly, the operations are performed on a linear arrangement of 30000 cells; the cells are initialized to 0.
To access a cell a pointer is used; the pointer is initialized to 0. The cell accessible by the pointer at a given moment 
in exection time is called the current cell. 

The Bf.loop is defined with respect to the Brainfuck loop condition
    current cell != 0
