# 'bf_red' Dialect

An out-of-tree MLIR dialect contained in the MLIR Brainfuck project to enable folding of the Brainfuck commands '+', '-', '>' and '<'
The bf_red dialect is intended to provide an intermediate representation that enables 
folding of the Brainfuck commands '+', '-', '>' and '<'. The mixin of the Bf and bf_red dialect 
is called OptBf. Users can either map the related Brainfuck commands directly or the 
associated Bf operations to bf_red: 

    +  => Bf.increment   => bf_red.increment {amount = 1 : si8}
    -  => Bf.decrement   => bf_red.increment {amount = -1 : si8}
    >  => Bf.shift_right => bf_red.shift     {value = 1 : si32}
    <  => Bf.shift_left  => bf_red.shift     {value = -1 : si32}
